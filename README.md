## Project Description
Project to design surface and submersible vehicle pair to explore underwater environments and deliver video data to an on shore operator.

The project uses [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) to control both vehicles.


## Requirements
Control of the system's movement should be able to switch between the surface and submersible vehicle. Ideally the two vehicles should move in tandom when the submersible is deployed. As the submersible moves the surface vehicle should be able to follow along. If not the surface vehicle should be able to remain stationary while the submersible is in control.

### Surface Vehicle
#### Locomotion


### Submersible Vehicle
#### Locomotion
The Submersible is required to maneuver with 6 degrees of freedom to allow for twisting and wider range of motions to be taken while the submersible is in an underwater environment.
#### Video
The Submersible requires a camera that can provide a video stream while submersed. 
#### Optional Additions
